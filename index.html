       <h4>Life</h4>

        <p>
        
        C.N. Annadurai was born to Natarajan and Bangaru Ammal, in Conjeevaram (now called Kanchipuram) in Tamil
        Nadu. He was born in a middle-class weaver family belonging to Sengunta Mudaliar caste. He was brought up by
        his sister Rajamani Ammal. Annadurai attained his formal education from Pachaiyappa's High School in
        Chennai, but left his studies midway due to financial problems and worked as a clerk in Kanchipuram
        municipal office to help with the family finances. He later took admission in Pachaiyappa's College for his
        graduation. However, he was married off with Rani in 1930 at the age of 21 while he was still a student. In
        1934, he completed his B.A. (Hons) degree and later achieved his M.A. degree in economics and politics from
        the same college. For a short period, he earned his living as an English teacher in Pachaiyappa's High
        school but left to join journalism and politics.

        <h4>Political career</h4>
        <p>
        Entry into Politics 
        Annadurai was keen on joining politics. With his deep interest in working for the conditions of the poor and
        down-trodden, his ambition firmed as he was highly influenced by two Communist leaders, M. Singaravelu and
        C. Basudev. On his first meeting with Periyar E.V. Ramasami in 1934 at a youth conference at Tirupur in
        Coimbatore district, he was instantly attracted towards him. Even after his split with Periyar on the launch
        of his own party DMK in 1949, he continued to praise him in public as his one and only leader. He joined the
        Justice Party, which was formed in 1917 by non-Brahmin elites, in 1935. When he entered the party, the
        president was Periyar E.V. Ramasami. The party ran a magazine where Annadurai served as the sub-editor. The
        party was in power till 1937 after it was defeated by Indian National Congress. Thereafter, Annadurai became
        the editor of Viduthalai, which means freedom in English, and was even associated with a Tamil weekly paper
        "Kudi Arusu". In 1942, he began his own Tamil journal titled "Dravida Nadu". Periyar renamed the Justice
        Party as Dravidar Kazhagam in 1944 and bid adieu to contesting in the elections.
    </p>
        <h5>Establishment of DMK</h5><p>
        During India's struggle for independence, the movement was dominated by Indian National Congress that was
        led by Brahmins. As such, Periyar feared that independent India would be ruled under the government of
        Brahmins and North Indians. With this, Periyar objected the move and declared August 15, 1947 as a day of
        mourning. As such, Periyar witnessed opposition from his supporters and saw that the cause of demand for
        independence from British rule was a national cause and not just of Aryan North. 
    </p>

        <h4 id="Literary Career">Literary Career</h4>
<p>
        Apart from his political career, Annadurai was very much involved into writing and filming as well. Talking
        about his literary career, he was regarded as one of the best Tamil orators during his time. With his spoken
        and written language, he managed to develop a unique style. He penned several novels, short stories, and
        plays that revolved around politics. While working for Dravidar Kazhagam, he acted in some of his own plays.
        His notable works include Annavin Sattasabai Sorpolivukal (Anna's speeches at the state legislative, 1960),
        Ilatchiya varalaru (History of Principles, 1948), Valkkaip puyal (Storm of life, 1948), Rankon rata (Radha
        from Rangon), Kambarasam, Kapothipura kathal (Love in the city of Blind), Parvathy B.A., Kalinga Rani (Queen
        of Kalinga), and Pavayin payanam (Travels of a young lady).
    </p>
        <h4 id="Film Career"> Film Career</h4>
<p>
        Annadurai wrote for movies also. His first movie was 1948 "Nallathambi" (Good Brother) starring N.S.
        Krishnan revolving around cooperative farming and abolition of zamindari system. He earned Rs. 12,000 from
        this project, a large amount at that time. His novels "Velaikaari" (Servant Maid, 1949) and "Or Iravu" were
        culminated into movies. His career in films proved to be a boon for him as he was supported by several stage
        and cine stars, such as D.V. Narayanaswamy, K.R. Ramasamy, N.S. Krishnan, S.S. Rajendran, Sivaji Ganesan,
        and M.G. Ramachandran. His other works that were converted into movies by the same name are Panathottam
        (1963), Valiba virundhu (1967), Kumarikottam (1971), Rajapart Rangadurai (1973), Needhi devan mayakkam
        (1982).
    </p>
        <h4>End of Journey</h4>
        <p>
        However, he died of cancer just two years into office. His funeral had the highest attendance of any to that
        date.
        Several institutions and organisations are named after him. A splinter party launched by M. G. Ramachandran
        in 1972
        was named after him as "All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam".
